## samsung-mdc adapter for ioBroker

Control [Samsung commercial signage displays](https://www.samsung.com/business/displays/) (the
QBC/QMC/QEC/QHC families and other panels with MDC) over the Multiple Display Control (MDC)
protocol on TCP 1515: power, input source, volume, mute and status.

## What it does

One instance drives any number of displays. MDC is out-of-band: it needs no app on the display
and no pairing, and a panel keeps answering in standby when Network Standby is on. The adapter
opens a fresh TCP connection per request, so a dead panel cannot stall the others.

This adapter is for **commercial signage** panels. Consumer Samsung TVs do not speak MDC.

## Requirements

- Node.js 22 or newer
- js-controller 6.0.11 or newer
- Admin 7.6.20 or newer
- On every display:
  - **System → Power Control → Network Standby: On** (and Max Power Saving: Off). Without it the
    panel stops answering about a minute after it is switched off, and it cannot be switched on
    over MDC.
  - MDC control over the network enabled, and the display's set ID known (0 for a panel on its
    own address).

## Configuration

| Setting | |
|---|---|
| Displays | One row per display: name, IP address, port (1515), display ID (the MDC set ID) and an optional MAC address for Wake-on-LAN. The name becomes the object folder; leave it empty to use the IP address. A row that is switched off keeps its objects. |
| Search for displays | Probes an address range for panels that answer MDC on port 1515 with set ID 0 and adds them to the table. See [Discovery](#discovery). |
| Polling interval | How often each display is polled, 5 to 3600 seconds (default 30); 0 disables polling. Displays are polled 250 ms apart so a fleet is not polled in one burst. |
| Default volume on power on | Optional volume (0-100) sent after each power-on command. |
| Use Wake-on-LAN for power on | Sends a magic packet to the display's MAC address before the power-on command. Only needed for a panel that is fully off; with Network Standby on it is not required. It only reaches panels on the same network segment as the ioBroker host. |

## States

```
info.connection                     true if any display answered its last poll
<display>.info.connection           this display is answering
<display>.control.power    (rw)     power on/off
<display>.control.input    (rw)     input source: 33 HDMI1, 35 HDMI2, 37 DisplayPort, 96 MagicInfo
<display>.media.volume     (rw)     volume 0-100
<display>.media.mute       (rw)     mute
```

Input codes vary by model. On a QB43C only HDMI1, HDMI2 and MagicInfo are accepted; DisplayPort
is listed for the larger panels that have the connector.

### Display behaviour to know about

- **Power-on takes about 30 seconds on the control channel.** After a power-on command the MDC
  service restarts and does not answer for about 30 seconds, although the picture is back much
  sooner. The adapter expects this: it does not report the display as unreachable during that
  time.
- **Mute is not updated while a display is in standby.** A panel in standby always reports
  mute on, which says nothing about its audio, so the last value is kept.
- **A command that times out may still have been carried out.** The adapter reads the display
  back shortly after every command, so the states show what the display really did.

## Commands from scripts (sendTo)

Every command takes `device`: the display's folder id, its configured name or its IP address.
It may be left out when only one display is configured.

```javascript
sendTo('samsung-mdc.0', 'getStatus', { device: 'pitch_west' }, result => log(JSON.stringify(result)));
sendTo('samsung-mdc.0', 'power', { device: 'pitch_west', value: true });
sendTo('samsung-mdc.0', 'input', { device: 'pitch_west', value: 0x21 });
sendTo('samsung-mdc.0', 'volume', { device: 'pitch_west', value: 20 });
sendTo('samsung-mdc.0', 'mute', { device: 'pitch_west', value: false });
```

The reply is `{ ok: true }` (or the status for `getStatus`), or `{ error: '...' }`.

## Discovery

MDC has no announcement or broadcast, so displays cannot be discovered passively. **Search**
connects to port 1515 on every address in the range and sends a status request; a display that
acknowledges is added to the table with an empty name. The range accepts `192.168.230.0/24`,
`192.168.230.10-60`, `192.168.230.10-192.168.231.20` or single addresses, comma separated, up to
4096 addresses (a /24 takes about 12 seconds). The search works across routed subnets as long as
the ioBroker host can reach them.

Search merges into the **saved** configuration, so save pending changes first. Displays that are
daisy-chained behind another panel on a different set ID are not found and must be added by hand.

## Commissioning a display without ioBroker

`test-mdc.js` in the repository is a standalone probe (Node.js only, no dependencies) that reads
and writes a panel directly and prints the raw frames:

```bash
node test-mdc.js 192.168.230.200            # status, power, volume, mute, input
node test-mdc.js 192.168.230.200 power on
node test-mdc.js 192.168.230.200 discover   # try set IDs 0, 1 and 254
```
